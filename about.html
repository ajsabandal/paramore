            The band's second album, Riot!, was released in 2007. Due to the success of the singles "Misery Business", "Crushcrushcrush",
            and "That's What You Get", Riot! was a mainstream success and was certified Platinum in the United States. They
            then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, Brand New Eyes, is
            the band's second-highest charting album to date, landing at number two on the Billboard 200 with 175,000 first
            week sales. It produced the top-forty single "The Only Exception" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as
            well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealan
